## Total Score: 100 / 100

Exactly what I was looking for. I was able to login with the admin password 
and see the /users and /products links. I was able to add a new user and delete a product.
I was also able to see the /users/:id and /products/:id pages. Great job!

Best of luck with the rest of your studies.
